# Generic Excel Timesheet for Time-Tracking a Two-week Pay Period

This timesheet is designed specifically for professionals seeking to track hours-worked. The purpose of the timesheet is to give one a personal records of time worked. One should keep it honest and accurate. Each spreadsheet is two work-weeks, so this is built for a bi-weekly payroll (26 pay periods per year).

Each spreadsheet row for hours entry breaks down into six "slots" of beginning and end times. For instance, if I have a 7.5-hour day and begin at 8:30 AM, then take a lunch at 12 noon for one hour, ending at 1 PM, and then leave work at 4:30 PM, I would enter beginning at Slot 1 for today's date: `8:30[TAB]12:00[TAB]13:00[TAB]17:00[ENTER]` to get 7.5 hours. That would cover two slots. I usually use Slot 6 for PTO hours.

This timesheet is not intended to be used as a fiduciary tool or to calculate hours worked for business purposes, but merely as a tool for record-keeping and self-observation. 

To use the spreadsheet, you will need to "Enable Content". This will allow it to auto-fill the week number from one field and each day's date based on the "first Sunday" date.

Today's row for hours entry *should* highlight with a yellowish color, provided you save the spreadsheet or make any change or data-entry within it.

## Timesheet Continuity: making a tab for the next two-week pay period

In three clips and using the beginning of 2022 as an example, I show how to:

1. [Copy the current spreadsheet into a newer one](1%20copying-sheet-for-next-two-weeks.mp4)
2. [Rename the spreadsheet to reflect the next two weeks](2%20rename-sheet-for-next-two-weeks.mp4)
3. [Use the yellow-highlighted fields (B5 and A7, respectively)](3%20use%20yellow-highlighted%20fields%20to%20update%20sheet.mp4) to enter the Week number and the first Sunday of the two-week period

After making the copy and entering the above, I typically remove hours from timeslots, remove any comments from the previous two weeks, and begin time entry for the new pay period.

## Spreadsheet Cell Protection

Only the cells one should be editing are unlocked. Those cells include all the timeslot cells, the "comments" column, and the two yellow-highlighted fields mentioned above (cells B5, A5). Feel free to "unprotect" your worksheets, but there may be dragons, as I can't remember how I did all the things I did to make this spreadsheet the greater part of two years ago.
